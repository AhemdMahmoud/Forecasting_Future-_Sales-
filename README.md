## Introduction

Stock market data is rich in information and presents a challenging yet rewarding environment for analysis. Time series analysis provides powerful tools to understand the dynamics of stock prices over time. In this project, we employ various time series analysis techniques to explore historical stock market data and extract meaningful insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock price data . It includes Month opening, closing, high, and low prices, as well as trading volumes for a range of stocks over a specified period.

## Methods

We utilize several time series analysis techniques, including but not limited to:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, trends, and anomalies.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying statistical tests and metrics to analyze the distribution, volatility, and other characteristics of stock prices.
- **Time Series Decomposition:** Decomposing the time series into its constituent components (trend, seasonality, and noise) to better understand underlying patterns.
- **Forecasting:** Using models such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARMA for predicting future stock prices.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigating the relationships between different stocks or market indices to identify potential dependencies and diversification opportunities.

## Results

Our analysis yields the following insights:

- Identification of significant trends and seasonality in stock prices.
- Forecasting models that demonstrate predictive capabilities for future price movements.
- Correlation analysis revealing relationships between different stocks or market indices.
- Identification of potential trading opportunities or risk mitigation strategies based on the analysis results.
