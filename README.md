# Introduction

## Sales market data is rich in information and presents a challenging yet rewarding environment for analysis. Time series analysis provides powerful tools to understand the dynamics of sales over time. In this project, we employ various time series analysis techniques to explore historical sales data and extract meaningful insights.

## Dataset

### The dataset used in this project consists of historical sales data. It includes monthly opening, closing, high, and low sales, as well as other relevant metrics over a specified period.

## Methods

### We utilize several time series analysis techniques, including but not limited to:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, trends, and anomalies.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying statistical tests and metrics to analyze the distribution, volatility, and other characteristics of sales data.
- **Time Series Decomposition:** Decomposing the time series into its constituent components (trend, seasonality, and noise) to better understand underlying patterns.
- **Forecasting:** Using models such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARMA for predicting future sales trends.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigating the relationships between different sales metrics or market factors to identify potential dependencies and opportunities for optimization.

# Results

### Our analysis yields the following insights:
- Identification of significant trends and seasonality in sales data.
- Forecasting models that demonstrate predictive capabilities for future sales trends.
- Correlation analysis revealing relationships between different sales metrics or market factors.
- Identification of potential opportunities for improving sales performance based on the analysis results.
